# C-DNA-Dequences-Projects

C skills including functions, loops and arrays on problems involving DNA sequences. DNA sequences can be represented as simple character arrays that contain only the characters A, C, G or T, so programs that work with DNA are often written in C. You won't need to know any biology to complete this assignment.

Presented some problems in your (pretend) job as a software developer at the fictional AGTCorp, the world's leading company for synthesizing DNA molecules. AGTCorp is developing their latest DNA synthesis machine, called SEQbot, and joined the project to help the team prepare for the launch.

Working with arrays of characters, not strings. That means that these arrays will not necessarily have a null-termination character at the end, and cannot use string operations on them. This is also why all of the operations require the length of the array to be specified. The only string operations appear in main which you will not be modifying.
